## API Section
#### Requests

The below instructions assumes requests to staging server on port 3000

**Create a user:**

```
POST http://localhost:3000/users
body: {
  "email": "your_email@example.com",
  "password": "yourPassword",
  "firstName": "name",
  "lastName": "name",
  "streetAddress", "yourAddress"
}
```

**"Login" by creating a token** (expires after one hour)

```
POST http://localhost:3000/tokens
body: {
  "email": "your_email@example.com",
  "password": "yourPassword"
}
```

**Save the returned token in your headers:**

```
headers: {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Token: "your_token"
}
```

You can now make GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to the follwing endpoints:

```
http://localhost:3000/tokens
http://localhost:3000/users
http://localhost:3000/carts
```

In addition you can make a POST request to :

```
http://localhost:3000/order
```

and a GET request to:

```
http://localhost:3000/menu
```

**Example workflow for ordering a pizza (Given you have created a user and posted the token in headers)**:

**Get the menu:**

```
GET http://localhost:3000/menu
```

**Choose some pizzas and add them to the cart by creating it:**

```
POST http://localhost:3000/carts
{
	"email":"your_email@example.com",
	"password":"yourPassword",
	"pizzas":[1,3],
	"amounts":[2,2]
}
```

The 'pizzas' array contains the id of the pizza you want.
The 'amounts" array should contain the amount of pizzas you want where the indicies must match.

**Make an order:**

```
POST http://localhost:3000/order
{
	"email":"your_email@example.com",
	"cartToken":"tok_visa"
}
```

Note: **'tok_visa'** is a placholder for valid credit card information and will naturally only work in a sandbox environment.

That's it. The order will be placed and you will receive a reciept of the transaction to your inbox.
